# Getting Started #

This solution package contains materials to help both technical and business audiences understand our demand forecasting solution for the energy industry built on the [Cortana Intelligence Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/cortana-intelligence-suite/Overview.aspx).

# Business Audiences

In this repository you will find a folder labelled **Solution Overview for Business Audiences**. This folder contains:
- Infographic: covers the benefits of using advanced analytics for demand forecasting in the energy industry
- Solution At-a-glance: an introduction to a Cortana Intelligence Suite solution for demand forecasting

For more information on how to tailor Cortana Intelligence to your needs [connect with one of our partners](http://aka.ms/CISFindPartner).

# Technical Audiences

See the **Technical Deployment Guide** folder for a full set of instructions on how to put together and deploy a demand forecasting solution using the Cortana Intelligence Suite. The **Developer Journey Map** included there walks through the different components created as part of the end-to-end solution.
